## Motivation

Traditional Pairs Trading provides incredibly consistent and provable results, it requires intensive infrastructure to truly reap its benefits. This approach is applied quite a lot in industry, however can be inaccessible to a lot of invidiuals like myslef. We already know that information diffusion is not completely instantaneous and allows for the slight gaps which large companies generally operate in order to profit. Which leads me to the question: What if there is an instant reaction to pricing, but also, what if there's a slightly more lagged reaction which forms due to other factors surrounding the price fluctuations.

This project explores whether time-lagged correlations (which seems to be the technical jargon for these type of thought) between related stocks can be identified and exploited using daily price data, making the strategy a little more accessible and long-term friendly to traders without specialized infrastructure.


## Research Question

There are a few which I am hoping to develop some insight on:

1. Do statistically significant lagged correlations exist between large-cap and mid-cap tech stocks?

2. What is the optimal lag period that maximizes correlation for each stock pair?

3. How does correlation strength vary as we change the lag from 1 to 7+ days?

4. Can we profitably trade based on these identified lead-lag relationships?

## Hypothesis

I believe that larger-cap tech stocks will directly impact smaller related mid cap tech stocks with a predictable time lag. I still believe that the correlation will peak at the smallest time-frames, there will be a "sweet spot" which exists in a certain time frame which allows to make consistent profit.
